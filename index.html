        <p> LYRICS :
            Yeah
            I've been tryna call
            I've been on my own for long enough
            Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
            I'm going through withdrawals
            You don't even have to do too much
            You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
            I look around and
            Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
            No one's around to judge me (oh)
            I can't see clearly when you're gone
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
            I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
            Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
            (Hey, hey, hey)
            I'm running out of time
            'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
            So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
            The city's cold and empty (oh)
            No one's around to judge me (oh)
            I can't see clearly when you're gone
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
            I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
            Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
            I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
            I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
            Will never let you go this time (ooh)
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
            (Hey, hey, hey)
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
